            <p>Alfred Davis and his brother-in-law Hans Wilsdorf founded Wilsdorf and Davis, the company that would eventually 
become Rolex SA, in London in 1905.[13] Wilsdorf and Davis's main commercial activity at the time involved importing
 Hermann Aegler's Swiss movements to England and placing them in watch cases made by Dennison and others. These early wristwatches were sold to many jewellers, who then put their own names on the dial. The earliest
 watches from Wilsdorf and Davis were usually hallmarked "W&D" inside the caseback..</p>
 <p>The Hans Wilsdorf Foundation, which privately owns Rolex SA, is a registered Swiss charitable foundation and 
pays a lower tax rate.[19] In 2011, a spokesman for Rolex declined to provide evidence regarding the amount of charitable
 donations made by the Wilsdorf Foundation, which brought up several scandals due to the lack of transparency.
In Geneva where the company is based, it is said to have gifted, among many things, two housing buildings to social 
institutions of Geneva.s</p>
